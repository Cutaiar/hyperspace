"""The render graph (plan 26 A1, A3): the frame as nodes, evaluated in
dependency order.

`Renderer._draw_frame` (render.py) used to be a fixed list of passes.
It is now "build or reuse the graph for this frame's views, evaluate
it": `default_graph` builds the frame as nodes from each output's
`Switches` and the renderer's `Wiring`, and `Graph.evaluate` runs the
nodes once each, in an order computed when the graph is built, never per
frame. With the default wiring the graph is today's three pipelines
(`outputs.SCENE`, `SCENE_HANDS`, `HANDS`) and draws every golden frame
without hands byte for byte.

Seven node kinds. The owner's four (wishlist, "Render graph design
decisions"):

- **Geometry** (`Shape`, `Hands`): draw calls in the shared camera (the
  eye, `eye.*`), no framebuffer of its own. The shape is the see-through
  4D shape; the hands (`ghost.py`'s parts and styles, plan 26 A3) are
  solid geometry, settled once a frame (`Hands.run`) and drawn by
  whatever holds them — the scene, the hands' layer, or both. A4 adds a
  point cloud.
- **Scene** (`Scene`): any number of geometries into one colour + depth
  target (`render.SceneTarget`): the solid geometry first (the hands,
  depth written), then the sorted see-through shape, depth-tested against
  them and writing its own visible surface after (`render.DEPTH_ALPHA`).
- **Layer** (`HandsLayer`, `Readout`, `Cover`): one geometry into its own
  target. The hands' layer is the hands alone in the shared camera with
  their own colour and depth (`Ghost.layer`); the readout is the guide and
  the tethers' labels, a texture laid on at the outputs, never through an
  effect (register row 80); the cover is the faces' coverage mask the
  look-back's occlusion reads.
- **Composite** (`Composite`): `over` laid on `under` — over, add, or
  depth-aware (hidden where the scene's visible surface is nearer,
  `render.LAYER_DEPTH_BIAS`): the hands onto the look-back's picture before
  the effects (today's "through"), or the hands onto the scene for the
  history.

And the three that wrap what exists (A1's call, registered):

- **FX** (`Fx`): the effect chain (`fx.FxChain`), one node per pipeline,
  the effects' order inside it as today. Inactive, it passes its input
  through untouched.
- **History** (`History`, `Capture`): the look-back (`lookback.Lookback`)
  as two nodes, because its composite must read the ring before the
  frame's capture changes it: `history` lays the echoes and the dream
  over its input; `capture` puts its input — whatever it is wired to: the
  scene, or the scene with the hands' layer (A3) — into the ring after
  every composite of the frame has run.
- **Output** (`Output`): one render output — `fit`, flip, the hands over,
  the readout, the dim — exactly `Renderer._compose`, so an output in
  another context gets the same five-step `outputs.Handoff`.

**Materialised and painted images.** A Scene or Layer node *makes* a
texture that lives until the next frame (`image(frame)`); the History,
Composite and FX nodes *paint* into whatever framebuffer their consumer
hands them (`paint(frame, dst)`), as today's passes do — the look-back
composites straight into the chain's half-float input, the chain writes
straight into the output's window. An intermediate texture there would
quantise the picture, so the painted nodes are pulled by their consumer
and the pipeline's last node (`Fx`) decides where the picture lands:
**a pipeline with one consumer at the frame size, unflipped, paints
straight into that output; otherwise once into a frame texture that each
of its outputs shows** (`Renderer._frame_target`, `_show`). A consumer
that needs a texture of a painted node (the capture of a composite) gets
it materialised once a frame (`Composite.image`).

**What is static and what is per frame.** The node set, the wiring and
the order are a function of the views' switches and the renderer's
`Wiring` (`graph_key`, `Graph.wiring`): the renderer keeps the last graph
and builds a new one only when either changes. Each output is wired to
its pipeline's end; per frame a through pipeline whose layer is not bent
— no effect on, or no hand drawn — stands down for the pipeline it was
laid onto, with the layer laid over at the output instead (`Fx.fallback`,
`Output.settle`): `outputs.route`'s table, as wiring. A pipeline with no
output this frame is skipped and its nodes read 0 ms.

Render stack (ARCHITECTURE §3): this module reads params through the
objects it is handed and never writes one; it imports moderngl and its
sibling render modules only, never params, routing, library, preset,
undo or control. Node methods are `run`, `paint`, `draw`, `image`,
`depth` — never `apply`.

      readout); one without the scene still gets the layer, over or
      through.

    The nodes: the shape, and the hands while anything draws them; the
    scene (the hands first when they are in it); the cover; the hands'
    layer while an output lays it on or the history holds it; the
    readout on its own when only the scene holds the hands; the history;
    per reachable pipeline a composite and the chain; the capture after
    every pipeline, from the scene or the scene with the hands' layer
    (`Wiring.history`); one output per view, after the capture.

    Plan 26 A4: the hands are one node per instance (`Wiring.nodes`:
    `ghost`, `ghost.2` …, each its own `Ghost`). Every node drawn into
    the scene is one of the scene's geometries; the layer — laid on the
    outputs that do not show the hands in their scene — is drawn from the
    node `into` "layer", else from the first (`Wiring.layer_node`), and
    named after it (`hands`, `hands.2`). An output showing the scene with
    hands in it takes the first in-scene node's readout; one taking the
    layer, the layer's."""
